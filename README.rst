Robocrystallographer is a tool to generate text descriptions of crystal
structures. Similar to how a real-life crystallographer would analyse a
structure, robocrystallographer looks at the symmetry, local environment, and
extended connectivity when generating a description. The package includes
utilities for identifying molecule names, component orientations,
heterostructure information, and more...

Usage
-----

Robocrystallographer can be used from the command-line or from a python API.
The package integrates with the `Materials Project <https://materialsproject.org>`_
to for allow generation of structure descriptions directly from materials project
ids. For example, to generate the description of SnO :sub:`2` (mp-856_), one
can simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    robocrys mp-856

Alternatively, a structure file can be specified in place of an mp-id.
Robocrystallographer supports the same file formats as pymatgen_, including
the Crystallographic Information Format (CIF), and common electronic structure
package formats such as POSCAR.

Python Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The two core classes in robocrystallographer are:

- ``StructureCondenser``: to condense the structure into an intermediate JSON
  representation.
- ``StructureDescriber``: to turn the condensed structure into a text description.

The format of the intermediate JSON representation is detailed on the
`Condensed Structure Format page
<https://hackingmaterials.github.io/format.html>`_ page.
A minimal working example for generating text descriptions is simply:

.. code-block:: python

    from robocrys import StructureCondenser, StructureDescriber

    condenser = StructureCondenser()
    describer = StructureDescriber()
    condensed_structure = condenser.condense_structure(structure)
    description = describer.describe(condensed_structure)

Both classes have many options for customising the output of the structure
descriptions. More information is provided in the `module documentation
<https://hackingmaterials.github.io/>`_.

Example Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example of the output generated by robocrystallographer for SnO :sub:`2`
(mp-856_) is given below:

   SnO2 is Rutile structured and crystallizes in the tetragonal P4_2/mnm space
   group. The structure is three-dimensional. Sn(1) is bonded to six equivalent
   O(1) atoms to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing SnO6 octahedra. The
   corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 51°. All Sn(1)–O(1) bond lengths
   are 2.09 Å. O(1) is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent
   Sn(1) atoms.

Installation
------------

Robocrystallographer can be installed using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install robocrys

Robocrystallographer requires Python 3.5+. The `OpenBabel
<http://openbabel.org/wiki/Python>`_ package is required to determine molecule
names. This is an optional requirement but its use is recommended for best
results. If you are using the `Conda <https://conda.io/>`_ package management
system, OpenBabel can be installed using:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c openbabel openbabel
