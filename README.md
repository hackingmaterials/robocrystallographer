Robocrystallographer is a tool to generate text descriptions of crystal
structures. Similar to how a real-life crystallographer would analyse a
structure, robocrystallographer looks at the symmetry, local environment, and
extended connectivity when generating a description. The package includes
utilities for identifying molecule names, component orientations,
heterostructure information, and more...

## Usage

Robocrystallographer can be used from the command-line or from a python API.
The package integrates with the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org)
to for allow generation of structure descriptions directly from Materials Project
ids. For example, to generate the description of SnO<sub>2</sub>
([mp-856](https://materialsproject.org/materials/mp-856/)), one
can simply run:

```bash
robocrys mp-856
```

Alternatively, a structure file can be specified in place of a Materials Project id.
Robocrystallographer supports the same file formats as
[pymatgen](http://pymatgen.org), including the Crystallographic Information
Format (CIF), and common electronic structure package formats such as POSCAR files.
More information can be found on the
[command-line interface page](https://hackingmaterials.github.io/robocrystallographer/cli.html).

### Python interface

The two core classes in robocrystallographer are:

- `StructureCondenser`: to condense the structure into an descriptive JSON
  representation.
- `StructureDescriber`: to turn the condensed structure into a text description.

A minimal working example for generating text descriptions is simply:

```python
from pymatgen.core import Structure
from robocrys import StructureCondenser, StructureDescriber

structure = Structure.from_file("my_structure.cif") # other file formats also supported

# alternatively, uncomment the lines below to use the MPRester object
# to fetch structures from the Materials Project database
# from mp_api.client import MPRester
# structure = MPRester(api_key=None).get_structure_by_material_id("mp-856")

condenser = StructureCondenser()
describer = StructureDescriber()

condensed_structure = condenser.condense_structure(structure)
description = describer.describe(condensed_structure)
```

Where `structure` is a pymatgen Structure object. Both classes have many
options for customising the output of the structure
descriptions. More information is provided in the
[module documentation](https://hackingmaterials.github.io/robocrystallographer/modules).

### Intermediate JSON format

The format of the intermediate JSON representation is detailed on the
[condensed structure format page](https://hackingmaterials.github.io/robocrystallographer/format.html).


### Example output

An example of the output generated by robocrystallographer for SnO<sub>2</sub> ([mp-856](https://materialsproject.org/materials/mp-856/)) is given below:

> SnO2 is Rutile structured and crystallizes in the tetragonal P4_2/mnm space
> group. The structure is three-dimensional. Sn(1) is bonded to six equivalent
> O(1) atoms to form a mixture of edge and corner-sharing SnO6 octahedra. The
> corner-sharing octahedral tilt angles are 51°. All Sn(1)–O(1) bond lengths
> are 2.09 Å. O(1) is bonded in a trigonal planar geometry to three equivalent
> Sn(1) atoms.

## How to cite robocrystallographer

Please considering citing the following publication if using robocrystallographer in your work:

## Installation

Robocrystallographer can be installed using pip:

```bash
pip install robocrys
```

Robocrystallographer requires Python 3.7+. The
[OpenBabel](http://openbabel.org/wiki/Python)
package is required to determine molecule names. This is an optional
requirement but its use is recommended for best
results. If you are using the [Conda](https://conda.io/) package management
system, OpenBabel can be installed using:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge openbabel
```
